<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Light Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflected-Light</li><li>Incident-Light</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital light meter market is categorized into two main types: reflected-light and incident-light meters. Reflected-light meters measure the light bouncing off a subject, making them ideal for photography and film, as they assess the light level that reaches the camera. In contrast, incident-light meters gauge the light falling directly onto a subject, providing a more accurate reading of the lighting conditions for consistent exposure. Both types cater to different professional needs in photography, cinematography, and other lighting applications.</p></p>
