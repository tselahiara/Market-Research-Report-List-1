<p><strong>The Optical Lenses for Lithography Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Printing Lithography</li><li>Proximity Printing Lithography</li><li>Projection Printing Lithography</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The optical lenses for lithography market encompasses various printing techniques, including contact printing, proximity printing, and projection printing. Contact printing involves direct contact between the photomask and the photoresist-coated substrate, achieving high resolution but limited scalability. Proximity printing maintains a small gap between the mask and substrate, allowing for improved depth of focus and resolution. Projection printing uses optics to project a reduced image of the mask onto the wafer, enabling larger substrates and higher throughput. Additional methods, such as nanoimprint lithography, also contribute to this evolving market.</p></p>
