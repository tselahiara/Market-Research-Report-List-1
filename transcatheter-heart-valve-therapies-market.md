<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li> Restorative Interventional Devices</li><li>Replacement Interventional Devices </li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transcatheter heart valve therapies encompass two primary market types: restorative interventional devices and replacement interventional devices. Restorative devices focus on repairing existing heart valves, enhancing their function without complete replacement. These are often less invasive and applicable to patients with less severe valve dysfunction. Replacement devices, on the other hand, involve the implantation of new valves, typically made from bioprosthetic materials, addressing severe valve stenosis or regurgitation. Both types aim to improve patient outcomes and quality of life through minimally invasive procedures.</p></p>
